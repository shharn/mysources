Problem Statement
In the grafix file format, a bitmap is encoded as a sequence of lowercase alphabetic words. 
All of these words are drawn from a dictionary that has been built specially for the bitmap by a compression algorithm. 
Each word in the dictionary has the same length.

It can occur that words in a grafix file are corrupted by poor transmission or storage media. 
In such cases, grafix attempts to reconstruct the original file by matching each corrupted word to a dictionary word 
that contains one or more of the same characters at the same positions.

You are given a , dictionary, containing every word in a grafix file's dictionary, and a , candidate, 
which is a possibly corrupted word in that file. If there is no dictionary word that has at least one character 
in the same position as candidate, then return the value -1. Otherwise, return the zero-based index of the dictionary word 
that has the greatest number of characters at the same positions as candidate. In the event of a tie, favor the lowest index.

Definition
Class: grafixCorrupt
Method: selectWord
Parameters: vector <string>, string
Returns: int
Method signature: int selectWord(vector <string> dictionary, string candidate)
(be sure your method is public)
Limits
Time limit (s): 840.000
Memory limit (MB): 64
Constraints
- dictionary contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive
- candidate is between 1 and 20 characters long, inclusive
- each element of dictionary has the same length as candidate
- only the characters 'a' to 'z' are permitted in candidate and dictionary
Examples
0)
{"cat", "cab", "lab"}
"dab"
Returns: 1
The word "dab" has two letters in the same position as both "cab" and "lab", but "cab" comes first.
1)
{"cat", "cab", "lab"}
"lag"
Returns: 2
Here, "lab" is the best fit.
2)
{"cat", "cab", "lab"}
"bic"
Returns: -1
The word "bic" contains a 'c' and a 'b', but neither character is at the same position in any dictionary word.
3)
{"zkv", "izs", "fed", "waa", "ttx", "bgt", "quy", "dtq", "dgo", "yrs", "cid", "nln", "pvz", "txt", "zun", "erd", "jen", "klh", "kxy", "emf", "mqt", "lza", "dzb", "ndx", "vfr", "jhs", "dkm", "elb"}
"cwd"
Returns: 10
4)
{"zhadjsg", "vzptftx", "fbaslxs", "ejejncm", "xpxkeae", "ixrrtzw", "ovctbzx", "sfzekhh", "lxzixjk", "jixdpik", "bkianck", "laclyin", "uqmdkfx", "dimswqo", "fojhetr", "grntrce", "obdtqwx", "bhojwcy", "zuuuvst", "mvqtoly", "aftmupx", "govuidx", "qklpret", "yptccki", "uxdnslh", "wudrusz", "uwxbvou", "ouytqun", "pjdexqe", "xraaqdw", "lxmoncl", "sjnjfgb", "qrlqgvc", "fgvoadm", "yohsrxw", "udpvrsr", "mklucgt"}
